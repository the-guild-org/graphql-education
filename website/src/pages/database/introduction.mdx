# Introduction

Your GraphQL API can connect to any kind of data source, such as a remote REST (or even GraphQL) API or database.

## Schema

The [same GraphQL schema](/get-started#schema) will be model for each of the database implementation.

Furthermore, every database implementation that follows has a resulting `schema.ts` file that is used to communicate GraphQL to the data source.

## Port

All databases in the [database](/database) module use the port **50000** ([http://localhost:50000](http://localhost:50000)).
