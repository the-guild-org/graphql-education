# Introduction

[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io) is an [open source](https://github.com/prisma/prisma) database toolkit that makes it easy for developers to reason about their data and how they access it, by providing a
clean and type-safe API for submitting database queries.

Combined with [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) as the database layer. It is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with over 35 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) LTS or higher
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) knowledge

## Setup

### Install

In your project, install and provide the necessary fields:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i prisma @prisma/client
```

### Environment

We'll use a dotenv file named `.env` to store the relevant connection and database configuration parameters.

```sh filename="examples/database/postgres-with-prisma/.env"
DATABASE_USER=user
DATABASE_PASSWORD=password
DATABASE_PORT=50000
DATABASE_DB=kanban
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://${DATABASE_USER}:${DATABASE_PASSWORD}@localhost:${DATABASE_PORT}/${DATABASE_DB}"
```

## Start

Using Docker, we'll create a Postgres instance that we'll use.

Start by creating a `docker-compose.yaml` file in the same directory as our `.env`.

```yaml filename="examples/database/postgres-with-prisma/docker-compose.yaml"
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=$DATABASE_USER
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$DATABASE_PASSWORD
      - PGPORT=$DATABASE_PORT
      - POSTGRES_DB=$DATABASE_DB
    ports:
      - $DATABASE_PORT:$DATABASE_PORT
```

After having configured Postgers, start the instance by simply running:

```sh
docker compose up
```

## Client

Finally, we'll use the Prisma client. This same client will be used throughout all of the schema chapters.

```ts filename="examples/database/postgres-with-prisma/prisma.ts"
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';

// The type-safe prisma client generated by `prisma generate`.
export const prisma = new PrismaClient();
```
