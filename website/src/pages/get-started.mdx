# Get Started

Welcome to the GraphQL Education, the last GraphQL Academy. A different take on learning GraphQL through practical approach. Each module is isolated modules for convenience and efficiency.

You're expected to have elementary knowledge about [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [GraphQL](https://roadmap.sh/graphql) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

The education modules are split into 3 different parts: the [database](/database/introduction), [server](/server/introduction) and [client](/client/introduction).

## Schema

All of the education modules are designed to the following data model. The [schema.graphql](https://github.com/the-guild-org/graphql-education/blob/main/schema.graphql) looks like this:

```graphql filename="schema.graphql"
type Query {
  """
  The currently authenticated user.
  """
  me: User
  """
  Retrieve a task by its ID.
  """
  task(id: ID!): Task
  """
  Retrieve available tasks. Optionally perform a fulltext search using the `searchText` argument.
  """
  filterTasks(searchText: String): [Task!]!
}

type Mutation {
  login(email: String!, password: String!): User!
  register(input: RegisterInput!): User!
  createTask(input: CreateTaskInput!): Task!
  updateTask(input: UpdateTaskInput!): Task!
  deleteTask(input: DeleteTaskInput!): Task!
}

type Subscription {
  taskCreated: Task!
  taskChanged(id: ID!): Task!
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  email: String!
  """
  All tasks that have been created by this user.
  """
  createdTasks: [Task!]!
  """
  All tasks that have this user set as the assignee.
  """
  assignedTasks: [Task!]!
}

enum TaskStatus {
  TODO
  IN_PROGRESS
  DONE
}

type Task {
  id: ID!
  createdByUserId: ID!
  createdBy: User!
  """
  Private tasks can be viewed and modified only by the assignee or the user who created it.
  """
  private: Boolean!
  assigneeUserId: ID
  assignee: User
  status: TaskStatus!
  title: String!
  description: String
}

input RegisterInput {
  name: String!
  email: String!
  password: String!
}

input CreateTaskInput {
  private: Boolean!
  assignee: ID!
  status: TaskStatus! = TODO
  title: String!
  description: String
}

input UpdateTaskInput {
  id: ID!
  private: Boolean!
  assignee: ID!
  status: TaskStatus!
  title: String!
  description: String
}

input DeleteTaskInput {
  id: ID!
}
```

## Ports

Some of the modules are exposed and communicated with over the network. All elements of modules will bind to the same ports for convenience:

- [Database](/database) uses the port **50000** ([http://localhost:50000](http://localhost:50000))
- [Server](/server) uses the port **50005** ([http://localhost:50005](http://localhost:50005))
