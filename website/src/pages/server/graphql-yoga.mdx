# GraphQL Yoga

[GraphQL Yoga](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/yoga-server) is a batteries-included cross-platform [GraphQL over HTTP spec-compliant](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-http/tree/master/implementations/graphql-yoga) GraphQL server powered by [Envelop](https://envelop.dev) and [GraphQL Tools](https://graphql-tools.com) that runs anywhere; focused on easy setup, performance and great developer experience.

## Installation

```sh
npm i graphql graphql-yoga
```

## Start

Provide the [database](/database/introduction) GraphQL schema to Yoga.

```ts filename="index.ts"
import { createServer } from 'node:http';
import { createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga';
import { schema, createContext } from '<database>/schema.ts';

// Create a Yoga instance with a GraphQL schema.
const yoga = createYoga({ schema, context: createContext });

// Pass it into a server to hook into request handlers.
const server = createServer(yoga);

// Start the server and you're done!
server.listen(50005, () => {
  console.info('Server is running on http://localhost:50005/graphql');
});
```

And run it:

```sh
npx tsx index.ts
```
