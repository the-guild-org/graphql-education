# Introduction

A GraphQL server is responsible for exposing the data source to the world and serving the data content.

## Schema

The [same GraphQL schema](/get-started#schema) will be served over each of the server implementations.

One of the [databases](/database/introduction) will be used as the data source and the server is free to choose any.

## Port

All servers in the [server](/server) module use the port **50005** ([http://localhost:50005](http://localhost:50005)).
